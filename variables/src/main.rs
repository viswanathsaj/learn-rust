// The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value (value greater than max index) 
// in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and didn't execute the final println! 
// statement. When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index youâ€™ve specified 
// is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic. 
// This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case, because the compiler can't possibly know 
// what value a user will enter when they run the code later.
